# Caffeine Quest

## A Coder Factory Academy challenge project
### About
Caffeine Quest is a sassy script adventure game that models the game world in OOP. MVP (donut without sprinkles) version takes the player through a linear narrative mode where they must answer a series of CS / programming questions to progress.

The aim is to escape school and get to a Cafe. Wrong answers to questions decaffeinate the player. They must reach the Cafe before they are TOTALLY DECAFFEINATED!

### Installation
Caffeiene Quest is written in Ruby and must have it installed (Ruby 2.4 or higher).

1. Clone the repo.

2. Caffeine Quest uses ```bundler``` to install dependencies.
```
gem install bundler
bundler install
```
The ```bundler install``` command must be called in the root directory of the repo.

### How to Play
Once you've installed the gem dependencies, enter the following into your
command line:
